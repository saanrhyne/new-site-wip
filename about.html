        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Howdy! My name is Saan Rhyne, and I am a high school sophomore from the great state of Maryland with a passion for cybersecurity and public policy.</p>
        <p>I created this website to share my ideas, experiences, and writeups with others. This website will mainly focus on cyber-related topics, and there may be some posts generally relating to high school.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I hope to dual major in cybersecurity and public policy in college</li>
            <li>I would like to serve my fellow Americans through a role in government or service</li>
            <li>I am involved in student leadership and advocacy on the county and state level</li>
            <li>I compete in CyberPatriot and CTF competitions, and was a CyberPatriot National Finalist in the 2024-25 season</li>
            <li>I train in Seido karate, where I am a brown belt, and hold a junior black belt in Jiu Jitsu</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feel free to contact me via email at <a href="mailto:contact@saanrhyne.com">contact@saanrhyne.com</a> if you want to discuss cybersecurity, public policy, high school, or anything else. I hope you enjoy reading my blog, and that you learn something from it. Have a great day!</p>
